<p>DevOps is all about getting teams to build and deploy code faster without sacrificing reliability. Think of it as a blend of automating tasks, making sure apps are running consistently everywhere, and smart monitoring to catch issues early.</p>

<p>Before DevOps, development and operations teams worked separately with minimal communication. Developers would build software in their own environment, then hand it off to operations to deploy it to users.</p>

<p>But operations couldn't immediately deploy the code. They needed to carefully test it first, make sure it wouldn't break existing systems, and prepare the infrastructure - all without knowing how the code was written.</p>

<p>This created delays, misunderstandings, and frustration on both sides: developers wanted to ship features quickly, while operations wanted to make sure the code is stable before it's deployed.</p>

<p>To address this conflict, DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software.</p>

<b>If DevOps is a set of practices, what is a DevOps engineer?</b>
<p>DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. They...</p>

<p>1. Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>2. Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.</p>
<p>3. Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.</p>
<p>At the heart of DevOps is CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.</p>
